# Finite Element Analysis of Magnetic Systems

This repository is a knowledge base for the finite element analysis of magnetic systems. It is intended to be a collection of resources, tutorials, and examples for the simulation of magnetic fields and forces using finite element analysis (FEA) software.

## 2D Magnetic Analysis

### FEMM

- [FEMM](https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) is a free 2D finite element analysis software for electromagnetic fields. It is a powerful tool for the simulation of magnetic fields and forces in 2D systems.
